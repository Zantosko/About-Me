        <p>Nice to meet all of you! My name is Zach, I'm 24 years old and a former chemical engineer from Houston, TX. After nearly 2 years in industry I decided that engineering wasn't the profession for me. I've always had an interest in coding since college and now I've finally decided to take the leap with all of you. I have some prior experience with coding, but I'm hoping to add on to that knowlege and land a career as a Software Engineer. I'm excited for what this journey has in store for us and I'm looking forward to meeting all of you!</p>
